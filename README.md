# Tutorials
A very good start of Machine Learning and Deep Learning basic tutorials. This repository contains notebook codes (well commented)  , just clone/download  and run the notebook cell by cell for deep understanding.

### Python Quick Practice
  * It contains notebooks to quick start and understand python structures 
### Deep Learning
  * 1. Neural Networks Tutorial â€“ A Pathway to Deep Learning.ipynb
      * This notebook Constructs Neural Network without using any module.
  * 2. Convolutional Neural Networks Tutorial in PyTorch.ipynb
      * This notebook use pytorch and torchvision module to construct CNNs
### Machine Learning
  * It contains notebooks(well documented) of basic models/classifers on toy datasets.
